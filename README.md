# jenkins-agent-arm64
Jenkins agent for ARM64 architecture. There was no Jenkins agent for the ARM64 architecture. This image is based on the original files except it uses a different base image for the JDK. Also installs the Docker CLI to issue Docker commands. This does not install docker itself, just the client!
